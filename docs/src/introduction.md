# Introduction

Icejar is software for extending a [Mumble](https://mumble.info) server's
capabilities using [ZeroC Ice](https://zeroc.com/products/ice) with the Java
programming language.

Its purpose is to handle the tedious bits of using Mumble's Ice functionaliy:
instead of starting from scratch, Icejar allows you to write "modules" contain
additional functionality but *not* low-level details like connection and
configuration management. These details are provided by Icejar.
