# Writing Modules

This chapter covers the basics of writing modules for Icejar.

## Setup

You can use a proper build system to write modules, but in this tutorial we
will just be using the java compiler directly.

Create a directory in which you will write your module. It should have the
following contents:

* A new file called `Module.java`: this will be the source for the module
* `MumbleIceModuleAPI.jar` (see [Building](building.md))

## Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is not to create a useful module
(see [Examples](example_modules.md) for those).

Its purpose is to introduce Icejar's features and their intended usage.
